                    <p class='lead mb-4'>For our last project, we were challenged to create an interactive, playful experience for students at a school for the deaf who would be interacting with it via zoom. This project introduced us to the concepts of accessible design, and we were even able to talk to the students about what would make the project more accessible for them. This was also a group project. Our team decided to build a remote controlled two player shuffleboard game which the students would be able to control from laptops at their school. The game had several components. Two launchers sat on each side of a play board, and would fire pucks at designated angles and powers chosen by the students. The game then calculated each player's score based on where the pucks landed using a computer vision algorithm which looked for red and blue disks in a grid of points. These scores were sent back to the students, who would then fire again. The student who had the most points after firing four disks would win. The players each had their own remote website which both received the score from, and deposited their choices onto a database. Two local websites watched the database for fire commands, and would then take the parameters the students chose, and send them as programs to the launcher robots. A final local website ran the computer vision algorithm and updated the database with new scores every second.<br>In terms of accessible design, we wanted our websites to be accessible to someone who didn't know any English, since many of the students knew ASL as a first language, and were learning English as a second or third. We put symbols next to every action that described their function, and included a video of a translator signing the instructions for our game. We put lots of white space on our page so students using eye trackers had somewhere to rest their cursors, and also left white space inbetween buttons so students with impaired motor function could click the right button without hitting the wrong one.</p>
