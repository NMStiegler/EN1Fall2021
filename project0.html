        <h1>Project 0</h1>

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Our first project was to make something with the LEGO pieces which represented something about ourselves. I chose a carabiner because I like to rock climb! I iterated a lot with the closing mechanism, and I'm really happy with what I came up with. Although you couldn't climb with this, it does feel like you're opening and closing a carabiner when you use it. The only non-LEGO piece I used was a rubber band.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p><i>Designing even simple lnon-robotic devices like carabiners can be really difficult! I had to consider and balance many different design characteristics such as shape, size, weight, strength, reliability, color, and more. I spent several hours refining this design, but I'm really happy I did because I'm proud of how it turned out.</i></p>
